        I got my first and only tattoo on the night I turned 18.
        I had gotten the image off of a google search of the word "glyph"
        because my friend had suggested it (window 1). At the time, I really
        liked it because it was simple and the pinterest chart told me it meant content.
        My friends all used to call it my barcode (window 2). I think it looks more like actual content
        on a page (window 3). Looking back at it, I actually think that is what it was supposed to mean in
        the first place. Now, over time, the lines have kind of bled together. I wish it looked
        like a cool wave pattern or something (window 4). Instead, it's just turning into
        a block (window 5).

        <br> <br>

        And the future may hold some unexpected changes (window 6).

        <br><br>

        Such is life.
