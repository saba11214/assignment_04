## Michelle's original icons featured her tattoos in the context of the past and present, meaning how she wanted her tattoo to be and how it looks now. I decided to take a peak into the future and imagine how the tattoo would look in a couple of years using the storyline she had already laid out. So I came up with a new distorted look for the tattoo, making it slightly unrecognizable while still keeping some of her original aesthetics. You can check out her original SVG icons [here](https://github.com/mboukhover/assignment_04).
